		<h2>Abstract</h2>
		<section class="two_columns">
		<div class="column">
			<p> Health care is one of the most important human needs. High quality
                health care will save millions of lives and provide people with a sense of
                safety and security. However, treatment of health problems such as
                cardiovascular disease, cancer, SMA and etc. can be very expensive and
                most of the people cannot afford it. These people try to use social media
                platforms to raise money to pay for the medications. Unfortunately, impostors
                can also share fake posts on social media to collect money. Many people
                hesitate to donate money because it is not possible to track how this money
                will be spent later on. The purpose of this project is to create a safe and dedicated welfare platform for those people.
